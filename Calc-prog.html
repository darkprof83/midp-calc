MIDP devices</h1>

<h2>Programming examples</h2>

In the program listings, the most basic commands are written as just
the command name, such as "ENTER", "*", and numbers such as
"0.5". Commands that are found deeper down in the menu hierarchy will
be written prefixed with <em>some parts</em> of the menu choices
needed to get to the command. This is done to <em>remind</em> the user
how to find the command, it is not meant as a complete description of
how to find the command. For example, if I write "<tt><b>stack/RCL st#
1</b></tt>", I actually mean
"<tt>main/special/<b>stack</b>/more/<b>RCL&nbsp;st#</b>/&lt;0-3&gt;/&lt;<b>1</b>&gt;</tt>".<br>

<br>
Programming hint: If a program needs parameters pushed onto the stack
before running, it is useful to push some dummy arguments on the stack
before starting to record the program, to be able to follow the
programming with actual data.<br><br>

<h3>Quadratic equation</h3>

This program solves a second-order polynomial of the type<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ax²&nbsp;+&nbsp;bx&nbsp;+&nbsp;c&nbsp;=&nbsp;0<br>

<br>
The method used is accurate also if b²&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;4ac, as described
<a
href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/QuadraticEquation.html">here</a>. Before
running the program, push the coefficients a, b, and c to the stack,
in that order. On exit, the stack contains the original coefficients
plus the two roots (real or complex).<br>

<br><b>Program listing:</b>

<pre>
prog/new "Quad"          ; start recording a new program
stack/RCL st# 1          ; b
math/simple/x²

/                        ; q = -(b+sgn(b)*sqrt(b²-4ac))/2

<h3>Biorhythms</h3>

The theory of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biorhythms">biorhythms</a> is
speculative, but slightly entertaining. To program it, we use the fact
that real numbers are drawn as a pink line, imaginary parts of complex
numbers are drawn as a yellow line, and points where the imaginary and
real parts of a complex number coincide, are drawn with a white
color. In addition we use the fact that if a program result alternates
between values, many graphs can be drawn together. This program is
only intended to be "draw"n, if you "run" the program, you will get
alternating results.<br>

<br><b>Program listing:</b>

<pre>
prog/new "BioRt"         ; start recording a new program
conv/time/now            ; get current time
mem/RCL 0                ; get birthday
+/-
conv/time/DH.MS+         ; subtract dates
conv/time/->H            ; hours since birthday
24
/                        ; days since birthday
+                        ; add x offset (on stack at start of program)
trig/pi
ENTER
+
*                        ; multiply by 2*pi to convert to radians
ENTER
ENTER                    ; 3 copies now on stack
23
/
trig/sin                 ; physical cycle is 23 days
stack/x<->y
28
/
trig/sin                 ; emotional cycle is 28 days
math/coord/r->cplx       ; make complex number, re=emotional, im=physical
stack/x<->y
33
/
trig/sin                 ; intellectual cycle is 33 days
ENTER
math/coord/r->cplx       ; make complex number with re=im
mem/RCL 1                ; memory location 1 alternates between 0 and 1
+/-
1
+
mem/STO 1                ; alternating number calculated and stored
prog/util/select         ; select y or z depending on alternating number
prog/finish              ; program finished
</pre>

<br>
Preparations: To try the program, store your birthday in memory
location 0, store 0 in memory location 1, make sure calculator is in
RAD mode, and push suitable graph limits on the stack, for instance
-14, 14, -1.2, 1.2, before finally executing "prog/draw/BioRt". The
pink graph shows your emotional cycle, the yellow graph shows your
physical cycle, and the white graph shows your intellectual cycle,
with zero on the x axis representing current time.<br><br>

and I might publish it here.
