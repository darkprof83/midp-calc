<h2>Introduction</h2>

Calc is a Java calculator for MIDP devices, such as a Java-enabled
mobile phone or PDA. It was developed on a Sony Ericsson T610, which is
my current phone but which has such a pitiful built-in calculator that
I was compelled to develop this application.<br>

<br>
Calc works much like a good old HP calculator with RPN logic, but the
stack has 16 elements and you can see many of the elements on the stack
simultaneously. I have chosen to use RPN logic (Reverse Polish
Notation), because operating it requires less keys, you need only ENTER
instead of "(", ")" and "=". Additionally, being able to store and see
intermediate results on the stack is very advantageous.<br>

<br>
Using the <a href="http://gridbug.ods.org/Real.html">Real</a> Java
floating point library, Calc has 63 bits internal precision, which
amounts to approximately 19 decimal digits accuracy, considerably
<i>more</i> than normal calculators and computers. The exponent is 31
bits, which allows for numbers up to
4.197·10<sup>323228496</sup>. Handy when you want to calculate the
factorial of 40000000.<br>

<h2><font color="800000">Disclaimer</font></h2>

<font color="800000">
The Calc Java program is supplied "AS IS", without any guarantee of
operation, and without any responsibility for damages which may result
from usage.<br>

<br>
To summarize: I might be stupid. You too.
</font>

<h2>Download</h2>

You can download Calc into your phone or MIDP device using one of these
links: <a
href="http://midp-calc.sourceforge.net/calc.jad">http://midp-calc.sourceforge.net/calc.jad</a>,
or <a
href="http://midp-calc.sourceforge.net/calc.jar">http://midp-calc.sourceforge.net/calc.jar</a>
<br>

<br>
<b>Download instructions:</b> If you have an internet (or wap) enabled
cell-phone, enter one of the above URL's while surfing. Try the ".jad"
URL first, if that doesn't work, then try the ".jar". If your device
is not internet enabled, you need a computer link with synchronization
software for your device. Download one of the above URL's to the
computer and add it to the synchronization software before
synchronizing. In the latter case I would probably try the ".jar" URL
first.<br>

<br>
<b>Upgrade notice:</b> If you are upgrading from an earlier version of
Calc (pre-2.0), the internal state of the previous Calc version
(settings, stack contents, memory contents, etc) will be
lost. However, the old data records will remain (taking up some
kilobytes of memory for no good reason) unless you
<b>delete</b> the old Calc application before downloading the new
version.<br>

<h2>Hardware compatibility</h2>

The following MIDP phones/devices have been tested or surveyed for
usability with Calc:

<ul>
  <li><b>Sony Ericsson T610, T630, Z600, Z1010, K700i, S710a</b>: Tested OK
  <li><b>Sony Ericsson P900, P910</b>: Tested OK. Very
  inconvenient to use because of the mapping of ENTER and +

<h2><a id="Keys" name="Keys">Keys</a></h2>

<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Read this section at
least.</span></em> To be able to navigate efficiently through
operation menus, Calc is best operated on a phone with a 5-way
"joystick" or equivalent arrow keys, plus a "clear" key, 12 number
keys and two soft-keys (those configurable keys below the
display). The keys are mapped as follows:

<ul>
  <li><b>0-9</b>: The number keys are used to enter numbers and as shortcuts
when activating operations that take a number argument ("STO", "FIX",
etc). In hexadecimal mode, you can enter the digits A-F by holding down the
keys 1-6 until the digit changes. 
  <li><b>*</b> : This key is used to enter the decimal point.
  <li><b>#</b> : This key is used to enter a minus sign or an "e" for
  exponent. (In HEX/OCT/BIN mode, the same key can be used to enter a
  "/". This sign is used to prefix a negative two's complement number
  and should be read as "an infinite number of 1-bits preceding the
  number". Pressing the # key again exchanges the "/" with a normal
  minus sign, indicating the input of a normal negative number
  which will be converted to two's complement on ENTER.)
  <li><b>ENTER</b>: This key finishes the currently entered number and puts
  it on the stack. If no number is being entered, the lowest element
  on the stack is duplicated.
  <li><b>clear, 'c'</b>: This key deletes the last digit in an entered
  number, clears the lowest element on the stack, and backtracks
  through menus. 
  <li><b>+</b> : This key adds the two lowest elements on the stack.
  <li><b>Joystick/arrow keys</b>: Pressing the middle of the joystick
  activates the menu. Pressing up/down/right/left on the joystick
  activates the corresponding sub-menu directly (you don't need to
  press the middle of the joystick first). Sub-menus are entered
  by further navigation with the joystick until an actual operation is
  activated. If your phone supports pointer input, you can also activate the
  menu by clicking the middle of the screen.
  <li><b>Hangup/Back</b>: All devices have some key that exits the
  application, most often it is called "hangup", "back", "return" or
  has a symbol of some sort to this effect. On some devices,
  e.g. K700i, you must press and hold the button for several
  seconds. The state of the calculator will be saved.
</ul>

<h2><a id="Setup" name="Setup">Setup</a></h2>

To be able to use Calc on devices with fewer keys than the T610 (most
Nokias, that is), a couple of setup dialogs <em>may</em> appear the
first time Calc is started. If you don't answer these dialogs
correctly the first time, you can get to the setup dialogs again using
the "reset" command.<br>

<br>
First, to make sure that "ENTER" and "+" is immediately available,
Calc will rotate through a set of command-key mappings until you
answer "yes" to the question if you can see both "no" and "yes" mapped
to the left and right soft-keys simultaneously (These keys are located
left and right directly below the display). Some Nokias will at first
map "yes" and "no" to a menu named "Options" on the left side, with
nothing on the right side. If you select "yes" when such a mapping is
active, your "ENTER" and "+" key will be accessible in the same
cumbersome manner. <!--a href="Calc-keymapping.html">Why this
problem?</a--><br>

<br>
Second, to make sure that a "clear" or "c" key is available (and
recognizable by the application), you will be asked to press it. If
you do not have a "clear" key, press "#" instead - this will be your
clear key, and "*" will be used to magically enter both minus sign,
decimal point and exponent marker.<br>

<br>
Third, for color devices, Calc uses sub-pixel anti-aliasing to improve
the visibility of numbers displayed on screen. However, some phones
uses different pixel ordering (BGR instead of RGB), and then the
numbers may look strange. Select the font that looks best on your
device (beware that the commands "left" and "right" may be mapped to
the right and left command key respectively). Some phones may have a
90 degrees rotated screen where the red, green and blue color cells
are stacked vertically instead of horizontally. There is no support
for such screens, so on these devices the numbers will always look bit
strange, unless you select the "system" font.<br>

<br>
If your phone does not have a 5-way joystick, most times on Nokia you
can use the "dial" button instead of the middle joystick button. If
you only have a two-way joystick or none at all, the number keys 2, 4,
5, 6 and 8 will work as joystick keys once a menu is activated. In
that case, you can only hope that the menu will be activated by "dial"
or some other button, otherwise you will be stuck.

<h2><a id="RPN" name="RPN">RPN logic</a></h2>

If you are familiar with RPN logic, e.g. from a HP calculator, skip
forward to the next section.<br>

<br>
The basis for implementing RPN logic in this calculator is a stack of
numbers. The stack is initially empty, and when you write a number and
"ENTER" it on the stack, the stack grows upwards with the latest
entered number at the bottom of the stack. If you start to enter
another number, the numbers already on the stack jump up to make room
for the new number. To make the stack shrink, you can either clear the
lowest element on the stack using the "clear" key, or you can combine
the two lowest elements on the stack using a mathematical
operation.<br>

<br>
The lowest element on the stack is called "x". In operations with one
argument, such as "sin", x is used as input and is replaced by the
result. The rest of the stack remains the same. The element above x on
the stack is called "y". In operations with two arguments, such as
+,-,* and /, the x and y stack elements are removed from the stack and
the result is placed on the stack instead, as the new x. The rest of
the stack moves down one step. Sometimes the element above y is called
"z".<br>

<br>
For instance, to calculate 3+7, one would press the following sequence
of keys: 3, ENTER, 7, +. The result, 10, will now be the lowest
element on the stack, ready for further calculations. To calculate
3*(2+4), one would press the following sequence of keys: 3, ENTER, 2,
ENTER, 4, +, *. (To access the "*" operator, you really need to press
the key "&uarr;" to enter the "basic" arithmetic menu, followed by
"&larr;", to select the multiplication operator.)<br>

<br>
This is what the display will look like as you enter the sequence of
keys above, assuming that you start with an empty stack:<br>

<pre>
Keystrokes:     "3"   "ENTER"     "2"   "ENTER"     "4"      "+"      "*"
Stack:     |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |
           |        |        |        |        |   3.00 |        |        |
y:         |        |        |   3.00 |   3.00 |   2.00 |   3.00 |        |
x:         | 3_     |   3.00 | 2_     |   2.00 | 4_     |   6.00 |  18.00 |
</pre>

<br>
Notice that you don't need to press "ENTER" after the "4" (but you
<i>could</i>), because the following "+" operation makes it clear that
you are finished keying the number. As you press "+", the 2 and the 4
are added to produce 6, and the 3 jumps down, ready for the "*"
operation.<br>

<br>
A more thorough RPN tutorial can be found <a
href="http://www.hpmuseum.org/rpn.htm">here</a>, except that the
"ENTER" key works as in the HP <a
href="http://www.hpmuseum.org/rpnvers.htm#rpl">RPL</a> system.<br>

<h2><a id="Menu" name="Menu">Menu</a></h2>

Pressing the middle of the joystick activates the menu. You select
sub-menus by pressing one of the 5 joystick directions up, left,
right, down or middle. The next sub-menu will replace the previous
menu as you proceed. The following illustration shows the main menu
(light blue titled "menu") and the first level of sub-menus (minus the
"mode" sub-menu). In the case of the "special" sub-menu, the three
subsequent sub-menus activated by the right joystick button are
shown. Sub-menu entries are displayed in normal text and actual
operations are displayed in bold text. Through this hierarchical system,
almost 200 operations can be reached.<br>

<br>
Once you've familiarized yourself with the layout, you don't need to
press the middle joystick button to activate the main menu. Pressing
up/down/right/left on the joystick without activating the main menu
first activates the corresponding sub-menu directly. In this way, you
can reach the most used "ENTER" and "<b>+</b>" operations in one
keyclick (they are not on the menu, but on soft-keys), and the rest
of the most basic operations, "<b>-</b>", "<b>*</b>", "<b>/</b>",
"<b>+/-</b>" and "<b>%</b>" in just two keyclicks.<br>

<br>Some operations require a number argument ("STO", "FIX",
etc). When such an operation is activated, a two-level number menu is
entered, enabling the selection of a number between 0 and 15. When
this number menu is active, you can access the numbers 0-9 directly
using the number keys.<br>

<br>Since the middle joystick button can be a bit difficult to press,
care has been taken not to place the most used operations and sub-menus
on the middle button. Pressing "clear" while navigating the menus
backtracks up one level of menus.

<h3><a id="AbnormalNote" name="AbnormalNote">Abnormal results</a></h3>

The calculator implements infinities and <tt>nan</tt> following the
IEEE754 logic. It is impossible to enter abnormal numbers through the
keyboard, but they are easily obtained by calculation. If an operation
produces a result larger than the largest representable number, an
infinity value is generated, and "inf" or "-inf" is displayed. If an
operation produces a result smaller than the smallest representable
number, zero is generated. To be able to use this result properly in
further calculations, the number "-0" may also be produced. If an
operation is undefined, a <tt>nan</tt> value is produced and "nan" is
displayed (not-a-number).<br>

<br>
Abnormal numbers are often fine to use in further calculations. In
most cases where the final result would be meaningful, abnormal
numbers accomplish this. For instance, <tt>atan(inf)=pi/2,
1/inf=0</tt>, etc. In most cases where the final result is not
meaningful, a <tt>nan</tt> will be produced. Additionally,
<tt>nan</tt> is used to indicate "bad input parameters" or "failure
to obtain a valid result" from an algorithm implemented in the
calculator, e.g. factorizing.<br>

<br>
Examples of operations with abnormal numbers are:<br>
<tt>1/0 = inf</tt><br>
<tt>1+inf = inf</tt><br>
<tt>1*inf = inf</tt><br>
<tt>0/0 = nan</tt><br>
<tt>0*inf = nan</tt><br>
<tt>inf/inf = nan</tt><br>
<tt>inf-inf = nan</tt><br>
<tt>1/inf = 0</tt><br>
<tt>-1*0 = -0</tt><br>
Any operation involving <tt>nan</tt> produces <tt>nan</tt>, except
<tt>nan</tt> to the power of
0:<br>
<tt>nan^0 = 1</tt><br>

<h3><a id="ComplexNote" name="ComplexNote">Complex results</a></h3>

The calculator creates complex numbers automatically when you try to
use the "&#8730;<span style="text-decoration: overline;">x</span>"
operation on a negative number, or when another operation requires a
complex result. Alternatively, a complex number can be created from x
and y using the "r&rarr;cplx" operation.<br>

<br>
Most operations that logically extends to complex arguments have been
implemented for complex numbers, i.e. all basic operations, all simple
operations except "%chg", all power operations and all trigonometric
operations. For convenience, integer operations (rounding and
truncation) work on the real and imaginary part of the complex number
separately.<br>

<br>
All stack and memory operations also handle complex numbers. Financial
and statistical modules cannot store complex numbers, so with these
modules only the real part of the numbers are stored/used. Any
operations that are undefined for complex numbers or that have not
been implemented yet, returns <tt>nan</tt> when used with complex
input(s).<br>

<br>
If either x or y contains a complex number, any operation in the
"coord" sub-menu is undefined (the sub-menu dealing with
rectangular/polar coordinates). In this case the "coord" sub-menu is
exchanged with a sub-menu called "cplx" for dealing with complex
numbers.<br>

<br>
Complex operations work strictly in radians, so when the input is
complex (i.e. it has a non-zero imaginary part), operations involving
the angle of the complex number (i.e. most trigonometric and
power functions) will automatically cause a switch from degrees (DEG)
to radians (RAD).<br>

<br>
Complex numbers are displayed on one line as e.g. 2+3i. Since two
numbers are displayed simultaneously, the display may not be wide
enough to display both numbers if you are using a large font and the
numbers have large exponents. Instead "<b>*****</b>" will be
displayed. Don't worry, the number is still there, but you have to
switch to a smaller font or perform a "cplx&rarr;r" operation on the complex
number to view it.<br>

<h3><a id="FinancialNote" name="FinancialNote">Financial calculation</a></h3>

Remember to use negative values for owed balances and money paid to
the account, positive values for balances in your favor and money
withdrawn from the account. Also enter the interest rate per period,
not per year. If you are making monthly payments and have an annual
interest rate, divide the annual rate by 12 (*). Thus, one period of
an 8% annual rate is 8/12=0.6666%.<br>

<br>
[* This business of dividing an interest rate by 12 is not
mathematically correct, but since the banks use this procedure it is
wise to do it also, otherwise your numbers will not agree with those
of the bank. To calculate the nominal monthly interest rate from an
effective annual interest rate, use the "y%/x" operation, which
actually calculates 100·(<sup>x</sup>&#8730;<span
style="text-decoration: overline;">1+y/100</span>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1).]<br>

<br>
If you solve repeatedly and successively for each of the financial
registers, the values may start to drift away from the original values
because of inaccuracies during the calculations.<br>

<h3><a id="DateNote" name="DateNote">Date calculation</a></h3>

The calendar implemented by the DH.MS operations is strictly
Gregorian, which did not take effect until 1582 in Catholic states and
not until 1752 in Britain and her colonies (including the United
States). Dates before these years will be extrapolations of the
Gregorian calendar and will not match the Julian calendar of the
time.<br>

<br>
When converted to hours, a date is represented by the number of hours
since the imaginary date January 1st year 0 (in the extrapolated
Gregorian calendar). Negative dates are not interpreted as years BC,
but are instead represented as a negative amount of time equal in
magnitude to the date interpreted as a positive number. In this way,
you can subtract dates by entering a negative date and using
"DH.MS+". However, it is impossible to extrapolate the Gregorian
calendar to years BC.<br>

<br>
When converting from date-time format (yyyymmddHH.MMSS) to hours,
several checks are performed. If year (yyyy) is zero (i.e. input is
less than 1000000), the date-time format is instead interpreted as the
days-time format ddddHH.MMSS, where dddd is the number of days. When
you convert from hours back to date-time format, it is enough that the
number of hours is greater than 8784 (i.e. 24 hours times 366, number
of days in year 0) for the converter to switch back to yyyymmddHH.MMSS
format. This means that for dddd between 366 and 9999, converting from
ddddHH.MMSS to hours and back again will not yield the original
input.<br>

<br>
Beware that you must specify the year with all four digits. If you
specify a year with two digits only, you will be calculating dates in
a Gregorian calendar extrapolated to the years AD 1-99 (*). As an
intermediate result such dates are fine (e.g. a time interval,
resulting from a DH.MS+ operation with one negative operand), but the
result should be converted to hours or added to a proper date before
it is meaningful. If an intermediate result like this represents a
time interval less than one year, it will be converted to the form
"ddddHH.MMSS", where "dddd" is the number of days. Do not worry, this
form will interpreted unambiguously in further calculations with
DH.MS+.<br>

<br>
[* leap years in this period matches leap years in the period
1900-1999, so you may get away with it. On the other hand, the year
100 (in the extrapolated Gregorian calendar) was <i>not</i> a leap
year while the year 2000 <i>was</i>.]<br>

<br>
If year is nonzero, and month (mm) is zero, the month will be
interpreted as 1 (January). If day (dd) is zero, it is interpreted as
1 (the 1st of the month). If seconds (SS) is greater than 59, the
number is interpreted as that many seconds into the next minute. If
minutes (MM) is greater than 59, the number is interpreted as that
many minutes into the next hour. If hours (HH) is greater than 23, the
number is interpreted as that many hours into the next day. If day
(dd) is greater than the number of days in a month, the number is
interpreted as that many days into the next month (or the months
after). If month is greater than 12, the number is interpreted as that
many months into the next year(s) (unspecified how many days there are
in each of those months). E.g. the number 2003000000 is understood as
January 1st, 2003, at 00:00.00. The number 1403.5901 is understood as
14 days, 3 hours, 59 minutes and 1 second. Unfortunately, the number
1.9999 is understood as 1 hour, 99 minutes and 99 seconds, actually
2.6775 hours, considerably more than 2 hours (if that was
intended).<br>

<br>
Because a date-time value is represented with many digits, inexact
intermediate representation may cause inaccuracies to escalate. To
alleviate this, some magic rounding has been implemented so that
e.g. 99 minutes and 99.999 seconds is instead interpreted as 1 hour, 0
minutes and 0.000 seconds. This will catch a majority of the problems
that may occur.<br>

<br><i>Relation to Unix time</i><br>

<br>
Unix time measures seconds since midnight (00:00 UTC) on January 1st,
1970. Many operating systems and languages (including Java) use this
time scale, although many use a local time zone instead of UTC. Use
"DH.MS&rarr;unix" and "unix&rarr;DH.MS" to convert dates to/from this
time scale.<br>

<br><i>Relation to Julian Days</i><br>

<br>
Astronomers often use Julian Day or Modified Julian Day as a practical
format for doing arithmetic with dates. The Julian Day is the number
of days elapsed since noon on Monday, January 1st 4713 BC (in the
Julian calendar). Use "DH.MS&rarr;JD" and "JD&rarr;DH.MS" to convert
dates to/from this time scale.<br>

<br>
The Modified Julian Day is the number of days elapsed since midnight
(00:00 UTC) on November 17, 1858. Use "DH.MS&rarr;MJD" and
"MJD&rarr;DH.MS" to convert dates to/from this time scale.<br>

<br>
Beware that this calculator has no notion of time zones, it takes
whatever value the Java environment returns (through
System.currentTimeMillis()). If you are in a different time zone than
UTC, you may have to add or subtract some hours to get a perfect unix,
JD or MJD time value.

<h3><a id="ConstNote" name="ConstNote">Constants</a></h3>

The constants were found at <a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants">http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants</a>
and the metric conversions at <a
href="http://www.free-definition.com">http://www.free-definition.com</a>.
Constants given using "&equiv;" are as accurate as the internal precision
of Calc. Constants given using "&asymp;" are not precisely known by
science, but are as up-to-date as the CODATA internationally
recommended values of 2002.

<h3><a id="ProgNote" name="ProgNote">Programming</a></h3>

(Programming is found on the "mode" menu because it was added last and
I couldn't find a spot for it anywhere else. Despite this, not all
operations reached from this menu are "mode-like".)<br>

<br>
The programming mode in Calc is basically a keyboard/command logging
facility with playback. In programming mode (i.e. after executing
"new"), all activity is stored in the current program, but the
calculator looks and behaves exactly as before except a "PRG"
indicator to the upper right. There is no limit to the size of a
program, but beware, do not leave Calc in programming mode (look for
the "PRG" indicator), because Calc will <em>eventually</em> run out of
memory and exit, losing any changes since the program was started.<br>

<br>
Programs cannot be viewed or edited, only recorded, so if you perform
the wrong operation you must start over using "purge". Using the
"undo" operation does not remove any statements from the program, it
only adds this operation to the program as well. Advice: If your
program is complex, plan the steps beforehand on a piece of
paper.</br>

<br>
The programming mode offers no control flow (if-statements) or looping
(repeat-statements). However, some conditional, utility and indirect
memory operations have been added. These operations are not needed in
normal, interactive mode since you can easily do them "manually", but
in programming mode they can help accomplish complicated programs. For
instance, programming <a
href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CollatzProblem.html">Collatz
Problem</a>; {If x is even, the next number in the sequence is x/2,
otherwise it is 3x+1}. This program needs an if-statement, but you can
get around this by calculating both values and selecting afterwards:
"STO 0", "2", "/", "RCL 0", "3", "*", "1", "+", "RCL 0", "2", "mod",
"select".<br>

<br>
A program is called a <b>function</b> if it uses the x on the stack as
input, and produces a new number on the stack as output. The value
left in the x register when the program finishes is used as the
function value f(x). During graph drawing, integration,
differentiation, solving, minimizing or maximizing, a program is
called repeatedly with different x values placed on the stack. If the
program does not clutter the stack (i.e. it does not leave more values
on the stack than the result), the input parameters will remain on the
stack when the operation is finished.<br>

<br>
When <b>drawing</b> graphs, you must first enter the ranges along the
x axis and y axis that you want to see during drawing.  If a program
returns a complex value, the graph will split into two lines of
different color. This is a neat way to display two (non-complex)
graphs at once, placing both graph values in x and y and using
"r&rarr;cplx". While drawing the graph, Calc will continue calculating
new graph points and improving the graph indefinitely, until "Break"
is pressed. Do not leave the program in this state, it will eat your
battery.<br>

<br>
When <b>integrating</b>, you must enter the range over which you want
to integrate, and the accuracy you desire from the result. When the
operation is finished, the result is placed on the stack. If the
program returns complex, <tt>inf</tt> or <tt>nan</tt> values during the
operation, the result will be <tt>nan</tt>. If the algorithm fails to produce
the desired accuracy, the unfinished result is placed on the stack
along with a <tt>nan</tt>. The algorithm may handle integration through a
singularity, but in this case the algorithm works better if the
singularity is at x=0 and the first integration limit is also 0. The
accuracy of the result will most often be of the same magnitude as the
input accuracy, but depending on the difficulty of the function to be
integrated, it may be much better or worse than this.<br>

<br>
When <b>differentiating</b>, you must enter the x for which you want
to differentiate. When the operation is finished, the result is placed
on the stack. If the program returns complex, <tt>inf</tt> or
<tt>nan</tt> values during the operation, the result will be
<tt>nan</tt>. The accuracy of the result is at most 13 digits.<br>

<br>
When <b>solving</b>, you must enter two limits that "straddle" the
solution, i.e. two x values for which the corresponding function
values have opposite sign. When the operation is finished, the result
is placed on the stack. If the program returns complex, <tt>inf</tt>
or <tt>nan</tt> values during the operation, the result will be
<tt>nan</tt>. The accuracy of the result is in most cases a full 19
digits, but this depends largely on the accuracy of the operations
used in the program.<br>

<br>
When <b>minimizing</b> or <b>maximizing</b>, you must enter two limits
in such a way that the calculator can decide if it should do
minimization or maximization. To decide, it inspects the function
value midway between the limits. If this value is greater than the
function value at both limits, the operation will be maximization.  If
the value is less than at both limits, the operation will be
minimization. If the value lies in-between, the criterion is undecided
and the result will be <tt>nan</tt>. When the operation is finished,
the result placed on the stack. If the program returns complex,
<tt>inf</tt> or <tt>nan</tt> values during the operation, the result
will be <tt>nan</tt>. The accuracy of the result is much worse than
for solving because of the flatness of a curve at a minima/maxima, in
most cases only about 10 digits.<br>

<br>
Caveat: Since the calculator can represent very small numbers
(i.e. 2.383e-323228497), solving or min/max-ing trivial cases when the
answer is exactly zero can take forever, since the result always
approaches zero but never gets there. Examples are "solve" on the
"sgn" function, and "min/max" on the "abs" function.<br>

<br>
Graph drawing, integration, differentiation, solving, min/max-ing and
calling other programs recursively cannot be programmed, as well as
commands on the "System menu".<br>

<br>
Here are some <a href="Calc-prog.html">programming examples</a>.<br>

<h3><a id="BinaryNote" name="BinaryNote">Binary representation</a></h3>

In binary modes (HEX, OCT and BIN), fractional numbers are not
displayed as integers, but are instead displayed with the fraction
visible in exactly the same manner as decimal numbers, depending on
the number format (normal, FIX, SCI and ENG). If a number is displayed
with an exponent, the exponent itself is still displayed in decimal
form.<br>

<br>
Negative numbers are displayed as a generalized form of "twos
complement", with the following interpretation: Negating the number
inverts all bits, including an infinite number of 1-bits before the
radix point and an infinite number of 1-bits after the radix
point. The infinite number of 1-bits before the radix is represented
by an "f" prefix (or 7 or 1 in OCT and BIN modes). The infinite number
of 1-bits after the radix is rounded upwards producing an infinite
number of 0-bits, until the first 0-bit is encountered which will be
switched to a 1 (rounded or not, these two forms are mathematically
equivalent). For example, the number "1", inverted, will become (in
binary mode) ...1111110.111111.... Rounding of the infinite number of
1's after the radix gives the number ...1111111.000000..., which is
exactly the way we usually see "-1" as two's complement.<br>

<br>
Bitwise operations with negative numbers (and, or, xor and bic) use
the generalized "twos complement" representation of the number when
interpreting the bits. However, beware that normal rounding that
occurs when the display cannot display all the significant digits of a
number may cause inexact values to appear different in the display
than their internal representation.<br>
