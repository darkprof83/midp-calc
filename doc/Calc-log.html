<h1><a href="Calc.html">Calc</a> - Scientific, Statistical &
Financial Java Calculator</h1>

<h2>Changelog:</h2>


<h3>Version 1.19, 2004-07-16</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed mixup bug between percentage function and statistics drawing.
  <li>Added "conversions and constants" module containing the old
  "time" module, US/metric conversion constants and scientific constants.
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.17, 2004-06-03</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Added mod and div, rearranged menus slightly to fit
  <li>Added complementary error function, erfc. At worst only 44 bits
  accurate (i.e. 13 digits, for x=5.44), mostly much better
  <li>Added stack roll-up, roll-down and x&harr;st#
  <li>More accurate sin, cos, tan for values » 2&pi;
  <li>Fixed accuracy problem of y<sup>x</sup>
  <li>Complex versions of trigonometric and power operations
  <li>Bypassing setup dialog (that does not work) on the Z1010
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.15</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Bypassing setup dialogs on known devices (so far: T610, T630 and
  Z600)
  <li>Support for sub-pixel antialiased fonts when display order is BGR
  instead of RGB (e.g. Ericsson T630)
  <li>Correct rounding in addition and subtraction routine
  <li>Fixed accuracy problem of e<sup>x</sup> and 10<sup>x</sup>
  <li>More accurate display of extremely large/small numbers due to
  accurate 10<sup>x</sup>
  <li>50-70% speedup of all operations due to inlining of small functions
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.13</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Correct rounding in multiplication routine
  <li>More accurate exponential functions due to better multiplications
  <li>atan<sub>2</sub> result correctly converted in DEG mode
  <li>Changed exponent marker from "E" to "e", and hex digits from
  "abcdef" to "ABCDEF" to improve visibility of complex numbers
  <li>Removed "+" sign from positive exponents
  <li>Basic complex math works for +, -, *, /, +/-, &#8730;<span
  style="text-decoration: overline;">x</span>, 1/x,
  x², cplx&rarr;r, abs, arg, conj and STO/RCL
  <li>sqrt(-0) correctly returns 0
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.11</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Made "int" submenu accessible in hex/oct/bin mode
  <li>Hex number "1.fffffffffffffffc" correctly displays "2"
  <li>Faster and correctly rounded division routine
  <li>Statistics log (used in "draw") now stores 64 x/y pairs and
  removes correctly on &#931;-
  <li>Using CRC rather than linear congruential generators in random
  number generator. RNG now passes <a
  href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/random/">ent</a> test
  <li>Released Real.java class under GPL
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.08</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Added percent command to basic menu
  <li>Added undo command to stack menu (removed x&harr;st#)
  <li>atan<sub>2</sub>(0,0) correctly returns 0
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.02</h3>

<ul>
  <li>y<sup>x</sup> faster and more accurate if x is integer
  <li>Added financial functions y%*x and y%/x
  <li>Added financial mode for beginning and end of month payments
  <li>Financial solving works properly with ir% = 0
  <li>Setup dialog to query about keyboard layout
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.00</h3>

<ul>
  <li>First public version
</ul>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Bugs:</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b><sup>3</sup>&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:
  overline;">3</span> = 3+1.44225i</b> &nbsp;[2004-08-25]
  <li><b>280 mod 4 = 1.806e-35</b> &nbsp;[2004-08-12]
  <li>Doesn't work on Siemens phones
  <li>LASTx forgets its imaginary part on clear stack and exit
  <li>Setup settings are not reversible
</ul>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Todo-list:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Fix the bugs, nothing else immediately comes to mind
</ul>

Long-term plans, that I am not going to implement unless I find myself
with weeks of spare time or somebody <a
href="https://www.&#112;&#097;&#121;&#112;&#097;&#108;.com/xclick/business=&#114;&#111;&#097;&#114;&#108;%40&#112;&#118;&#118;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;&#038;item_name=Calc+-+Java+Calculator">begs</a>
me:

<ul>
  <li>Simple programmability in the form of command macro
  <li>Graph drawing, root finding and differentiation of macro
  program. Integration only if I can find a simple, fast and accurate
  algorithm
</ul>

Things that <i>cannot</i> be implemented because the increased complexity
will make the application too large:

<ul>
  <li>Full programming mode with program listing, editing, and
  flow control operations such as IF, GOTO etc.
  <li>Vector and matrix arithmetic
  <li>Expression evaluation, e.g. "2+3-5*sin(34.5)^2"
  <li>Symbolic differentiation and integration
  <li>Spreadsheet, thesaurus and encyclopedia
</ul>
