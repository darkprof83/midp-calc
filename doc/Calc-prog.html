<h2>Programming examples</h2>

In the program listings, the most basic commands are written as just
the command name, such as "ENTER", "*", and numbers such as
"0.5". Commands that are found deeper down in the menu hierarchy will
be written prefixed with <em>some parts</em> of the menu choices
needed to get to the command. This is done to <em>remind</em> the user
how to find the command, it is not meant as a complete description of
how to find the command. For example, if the program listing contains
"<tt><b>stack/RCL st# 1</b></tt>", what this actually means is
"<tt>main/special/<b>stack</b>/more/<b>RCL&nbsp;st#</b>/&lt;0-3&gt;/&lt;<b>1</b>&gt;</tt>".<br>

<br>
Programming hint: If a program needs parameters pushed onto the stack
before running, it is useful to push some dummy arguments on the stack
before starting to record the program, to be able to follow the
programming with actual data.<br><br>

<h2>Drawing a function</h2>

Many people have requested a more thorough explanation of how to do such a
simple thing as drawing a function. To recap the long and perhaps tedious
documentation, a funtion is a program that uses the lowest element on the stack
(x) as input, calculates the function value based on this input, and leaves the
resulting function value in the lowest element on the stack as output.<br>

<br>
We will proceed to program and draw two different programs of different
complexity. The first program represents one of the simplest functions
possible:<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f(x)&nbsp;=&nbsp;x<br>

<br>
Let's see how we can make a program to calculate this function. When the
program is called by the graph drawing operation, the input value x will be
present as the lowest element on the stack. Since the input value of this
particular function equals the output value, we don't have to do anything to it
to it to calculate the function value. Also, since the output value of the
function should be located in the lowest stack element when the program
finishes, the program does not have to do anything either. Therefore, the
operations you need to execute to program this function are as follows:<br>

<pre>
prog/new "f1"
prog/finish
</pre>

<br>
To draw the function, we first need the boundaries of the draw area pushed on
the stack. We will use the area -10&lt;x&lt;10 and -10&lt;y&lt;10. After
entering the limits, we may execute the draw operation:<br>

<pre>
-10
10
-10
10
prog/draw/y=f(x)/f1
</pre>

<br>
This looks rather boring. However, the function is not completely useless. If
we use other drawing modes (with the same limits as above), we get some nice
results:<br>

<pre>
prog/draw/r=f(&theta;)/f1
prog/draw/z=f(z)/f1
</pre>

<br>
Now for a more complex example. The function we want to draw now is the
following:<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f(x)&nbsp;=&nbsp;2x²&nbsp;-&nbsp;3x&nbsp;-&nbsp;1<br>

<br>
One of the first problems we have to deal with is that we need 'x' twice to
calculate this function, and there is only one 'x' on the stack when the
program starts. We could use "mem/STO" to store the x in a memory location, and
"mem/RCL" to get it back whenever we need it, but a more common method is just
to dupliacte the number on the stack, using ENTER. One possible solution to
program the function follows. Before programming, clear the stack and enter a
dummy input value on the stack, e.g. '1', to be able to follow the
calculation:<br>

<pre>
stack/clear              ; clear the stack
1                        ; enter dummy input value (be wild: try '2' instead)
                         ; (text after the ';' is just comments)
prog/new "f2"            ; now we start programming our new function
ENTER                    ; copy x. Now there are two x'es on the stack
math/simple/x²           ; calculate x², using one of the x'es
2
*                        ; now we have 2x²
stack/x<->y              ; bring down the other x
3
*                        ; now we have 2x² and 3x on the stack
-                        ; subtract the two, now we have 2x²-3x
1
-                        ; subtract 1, now the stack contains f(x)
prog/finish              ; program finished
</pre>

<br>
Let's see how the program works. Clear the stack, and enter the number 3. Then
press "prog/run/f2". The '3' disappears and is replaced by '8'. We have now
calculated f(3)=8.<br>

<br>
To draw the function, follow the steps above, but select program f2 instead of
f1 for drawing.<br>

<h2>Quadratic equation</h2>

This program solves a second-order polynomial of the type<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ax²&nbsp;+&nbsp;bx&nbsp;+&nbsp;c&nbsp;=&nbsp;0<br>

<br>
The method used is accurate also if b²&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;4ac, as described
<a
href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/QuadraticEquation.html">here</a>. Before
running the program, push the coefficients a, b, and c to the stack,
in that order. On exit, the stack contains the original coefficients
plus the two roots (real or complex).<br>

<br><b>Program listing:</b>

<pre>

<h2>Solving an equation for different variables</h2>

Assume you have an equation having different variables, for example
the equation describing an accelerated motion from a starting height
h<sub>0</sub>, with accelleration a, and initial velocity
v<sub>0</sub>. You want to know the height h at time t. Then the
equation looks like<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h&nbsp;=&nbsp;h<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;v<sub>0</sub>t
&nbsp;+&nbsp;½at²<br>

<br>
To solve this equation for different variables, we make use of some
registers, one for each variable, the memory monitor mode and the
equation solver, and even function plotting.<br>

<br>
Since the built in solve command solves equations for 0, we transform
the above equation into<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;=&nbsp;h<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;v<sub>0</sub>t&nbsp;+&nbsp;½at²&nbsp;-&nbsp;h<br>

<br>
We use the following memory registers for the different variables, just
in order of their appearance in the equation:<br>

<br>
M1=h<sub>0</sub>, M2=v<sub>0</sub>, M3=t, M4=a, M5=h<br>

<br>
The register M0 will have a special role here: It will the determine the
variable we want to solve the equation for, e.g. set M0=3 for solving for
M3=t.<br>

<br>
For following this example, switch on the memory monitor mode
("mode/monitor/mem/<4-7>/<6>") and enter some values:<br>

<br>
M0=3, M1=100, M2=10, M4=-9.80665, M5=0<br>

<br>
(The 9.80665 can be entered using
"special/conv/const/astro/g<sub>n</sub>".)<br>

<br><b>Now we enter the equation as a program:</b>

<pre>
prog/new "Speed"         ; start a new program
mem/RCL 0                ; find out for which variable to solve
prog/mem/STO[x]          ; store value on stack in this variable
clear                    ; remove var number+value
clear
mem/RCL 1                ; start equation: recall h_0
mem/RCL 2                ; recall v_0
mem/RCL 3                ; recall t
*                        ; v_0 * t
+                        ; h_0 + v_0 * t
mem/RCL 4                ; recall a
mem/RCL 3                ; recall t
math/simple/x²           ; t2
*                        ; a * t2
2
/                        ; a * t2 / 2
+                        ; h_0 + v_0 * t + a * t2 / 2
mem/RCL 5                ; h
-                        ; h_0 + v_0 * t + a * t2 / 2 - h
prog/finish
</pre>

<br>
Now we can use the solver to find out which value for t matches the
given values for the other variables. To start the solver, we need to
specify a lower bound and an upper bound where to search for the zero of
the equation, eg:<br>

<pre>
0                        ; lower bound
100                      ; upper bound
prog/more/solve/Speed    ; call solver for our equation
</pre>

<br>
The result shows that after about 5.65 seconds we will experience a
pretty hard landing on the ground.  :)<br>

<br>
If we wanted to know what initial speed is needed so that a ball
starting at a height of 100m is at 50m after 1 second, we would enter:<br>

<br>
M0=2 (solve for M2=v<sub>0</sub>), M1=100; M3=1, M4=-9.80665, M5=50<br>

<pre>
0                        ; lower bound
100                      ; upper bound
prog/more/solve/Speed    ; call solver
</pre>

<br>
This gives us "nan" as result, since our guess of the bounds was
inappropiate. To find out which guess we could use, plot the error of
the equation:<br>

<pre>
0
100
0
100
prog/draw/y=f(x)/Speed
</pre>

<br>
The output looks like there is a zero for negative values of
v<sub>0</sub>. Hence try<br>

<pre>
-100
0
prog/more/solve/Speed
</pre>

<br>
This gives the result: approx -45.1
So we have to hit the ball quite hard ...  :)<br>

<br>
One suggestion: The hardest part is to remember which variable is
in which register. The memory mode displaying the entered/solved values
can be quite helpful for guessing which is which, but probabely you will
need a pice of paper here.<br>

<h2>DDD.MMSS conversions</h2>

The built-in conversions to and from the DH.MS date-time
representation is quite impractical if you are calculating map or
stellar coordinates and want to convert between decimal degrees and
degrees, minutes and seconds. However, a few small programs using the
already built-in conversions can help you out:<br>

<br><b>Program listing:</b>

<pre>
prog/new "->DMS"         ; start recording first program
ENTER                    ; make copy of input argument
math/misc/int/trunc      ; integer part
stack/x<>y
math/misc/int/frac       ; fractional part
conv/time/->DH.MS
+
prog/finish              ; first program finished


prog/new "->D"           ; start recording second program
ENTER                    ; make copy of input argument
math/misc/int/trunc      ; integer part
stack/x<>y
math/misc/int/frac       ; fractional part
conv/time/->H
+
prog/finish              ; second program finished


prog/new "DMS+"          ; start recording third program
ENTER                    ; make copy of first argument
math/misc/int/frac       ; fractional part
stack/x<>y
math/misc/int/trunc      ; integer part
stack/x<>st# 2           ; get second argument
ENTER                    ; make copy of second argument
math/misc/int/frac       ; fractional part
stack/x<>y
math/misc/int/trunc      ; integer part
stack/x<>st# 2           ; get first fractional part
conv/time/DH.MS+         ; sum everything...
+
+
prog/finish              ; second program finished
</pre>

<br>
Note: If you are able to enter the sign "»" in the program name, it
will magically turn into the sign "&rarr;" in the menu. In that case
you should call your programs "»D.MS", "»D", and "D.MS+" for clarity.

<h2>Biorhythms</h2>

The theory of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biorhythms">biorhythms</a> is
speculative, but slightly entertaining. To program it, we use the fact
that real numbers are drawn as a pink line, imaginary parts of complex
numbers are drawn as a yellow line, and points where the imaginary and
real parts of a complex number coincide, are drawn with a white
color. In addition we use the fact that if a program result alternates
between values, many graphs can be drawn together. This program is
only intended to be "draw"n, if you "run" the program, you will get
alternating results.<br>

<br><b>Program listing:</b>

<pre>
prog/new "BioRt"         ; start recording a new program
conv/time/now            ; get current time
mem/RCL 0                ; get birthday

conv/time/->H            ; hours since birthday
24

33
/
trig/sin                 ; intellectual cycle is 33 days
ENTER
trig/coord/r->cplx       ; make complex number with re=im
mem/RCL 1                ; memory location 1 alternates between 0 and 1

mem/STO 1                ; alternating number calculated and stored
prog/util/select         ; select y or z depending on alternating number
prog/finish              ; program finished
</pre>

<br>
Preparations: To try the program, store your birthday in memory
location 0, store 0 in memory location 1, make sure calculator is in
RAD mode, and push suitable graph limits on the stack, for instance
-14, 14, -1.2, 1.2, before finally executing
"prog/draw/y=f(x)/BioRt". This will draw the biorhythms for 14 days
before and after present. The pink graph shows your emotional cycle,
the yellow graph shows your physical cycle, and the white graph shows
your intellectual cycle, with zero on the x axis representing current
time.<br><br>


<h2>Advanced curve fitting example</h2>

Suppose we have a set of data observations and we want to find curve
that fits the points:<br>

<pre>
   x   y
 -------
   0   0
   5   6
  10  10
  20  17
  30  21
  50  27
</pre>

<br>
Looking at the points, the curve that seems to start at the origin,
grow linearly at first, and gradually lose its steepness towards the
right. One function that behaves this way is:<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y&nbsp;=&nbsp;a&nbsp;<i>ln</i>(bx&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)<br>

<br>
Now we want to find out if such a curve fits the observed data
well. The statistics module can fit a curve to the function
y&nbsp;=&nbsp;a&nbsp;<i>ln</i>(x)&nbsp;+&nbsp;b. If we add a parameter
c to the x values before summing the statistics, we can fit a curve to
the function
y&nbsp;=&nbsp;a&nbsp;<i>ln</i>(x&nbsp;+&nbsp;c)&nbsp;+&nbsp;b. This
curve corresponds to the function above
iff. <i>ln</i>(c)&nbsp;=&nbsp;-b/a. Consequently, programming the
entering of the above data points with modified x values, and
calculating the resulting <i>ln</i>(c)&nbsp;+&nbsp;b/a, we can find
our curve using the "solve" operation.<br>

<br><b>Program listing:</b>

<pre>
prog/new "fit"           ; start recording a new program
mem/STO 0                ; save input value, c

+                        ; output value, ln(c)+b/a
prog/finish              ; program finished
</pre>

<br>
Running the program with a few test values shows that c=1 and c=20 is
located on either side of the solution, and entering those limits
before executing "prog/solve/fit", yields the result
c=10.76295. Looking at the curve with "stat/result/alnx+b/draw" shows
a pretty good fit (although translated 10.76 along the x axis), and
the correlation coefficient "stat/result/alnx+b/r" returns 0.9996,
which indicates that the data is modeled well by the curve. The
coefficient "b" of the <em>original</em> function can be calculated
from the coefficients of our current function as e<sup>b/a</sup>, and
the coefficient "a" is the same.<br>

<br>
By letting the input value of a program modify a set of statistics, we
have used the solve function to perform a curve fitting out of the
ordinary. The resulting function is as follows:<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y&nbsp;=&nbsp;15.724&nbsp;<i>ln</i>(0.092911x&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)<br>
<br>


<h2><a id="Spline" name="Spline">Spline drawing</a></h2>

Given a number of 2D control points, a smooth parametric curve consisting of

     / -1  3 -3  1 \         / -1  3 -3  1 \
 1/2*|  2 -5  4 -1 |     1/6*|  3 -6  3  0 |
     | -1  0  1  0 |         | -3  0  3  0 |
     \  0  2  0  0 /         \  1  4  1  0 /
</pre>

A Catmull-Rom spline interpolates the control points but is only first
order continuous. A B-spline does not interpolate the control points
(it most often winds between the points), but it is second order
continuous, and therefore often smoother.
