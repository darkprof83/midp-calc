<h1><a href="Calc.html">Calc</a> - Java Calculator for cell-phones and
MIDP devices</h1>

<h2>Changelog:</h2>


<h3>Version 2.04, 2005-04-18, (57kB)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Added extra large font (I have K700i now...)
  <li>Enabled menu navigation by pointer/stylus input
</ul>

<h3>Version 2.03, 2005-01-02, (55kB)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Integration, differentiation, solving and min/max of macro program
  <li>Numbers entered in macro program are stored atomically, not as
  keyclicks (improves speed and fixes problem with HEX/OCT/BIN mode during
  programming)
  <li>Fixed programming function "select" to copy the number instead
  of calculating it when selection criterion x equals 0 or 1. This
  enables selecting away inf's and nan's.
  <li>Fixed wrong label order in mode/monitor/stat
  <li>Fixed "x&harr;y" bug when y is empty
  <li>Upgraded compiler tools and cleanup of Real.java
</ul>

<h3><a href="Calc201.jar">Version 2.01</a>, 2004-09-29, (53kB)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Added programming utility function "sgn"
  <li>Added room for a total of 9 programs
  <li>Reinstated "date" and "time" on a lower level menu
  <li>Application can be exited from the system menu (problem on
  K700i)
  <li>Setup settings are reversible by the "reset" command in the
  system menu
  <li>State is not lost if application is interrupted by incoming
  phone call
</ul>

<h3><a href="Calc200.jar">Version 2.00</a>, 2004-09-19, (52kB)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Simple programmability in the form of command macro
  <li>Extra operations to improve programming
  <li>Graph drawing of macro program
  <li>Added operations for converting between DH.MS format and unix
  time, Julian Days and Modified Julian Days.
  <li>LASTx remembers its imaginary part on clear stack and exit
  <li>Memory module will no longer be cleared on exit if it contains
  only pure imaginary numbers
  <li>Statistical results do not inherit imaginary parts from
  top of stack
</ul>

<h3><a href="Calc121.jar">Version 1.21</a>, 2004-09-07, (47kB)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Correct display of largest/smallest number, i.e. 4.197e323228496
  and 2.383e-323228497
  <li><sup>x</sup>&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:
  overline;">y</span> bug fixed
  <li>280 mod 4 correctly returns 0 instead of 1.806e-35
  <li>Fixed mixup bug between percentage function and statistics drawing
  <li>Added "conversions and constants" module containing the old
  "time" module, US/metric conversion constants and scientific constants
</ul>

<h3><!--a href="Calc117.jar"-->Version 1.17<!--/a--></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Added mod and div, rearranged menus slightly to fit
  <li>Added complementary error function, erfc. At worst only 44 bits
  accurate (i.e. 13 digits, for x=5.44), mostly much better
  <li>Added stack roll-up, roll-down and x&harr;st#
  <li>More accurate sin, cos, tan for values » 2&pi;
  <li>Fixed accuracy problem of y<sup>x</sup>
  <li>Complex versions of trigonometric and power operations
  <li>Bypassing setup dialog (that does not work) on the Z1010
</ul>

<h3><!--a href="Calc115.jar"-->Version 1.15<!--/a--></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Bypassing setup dialogs on known devices (so far: T610, T630 and
  Z600)
  <li>Support for sub-pixel antialiased fonts when display order is BGR
  instead of RGB (e.g. Ericsson T630)
  <li>Correct rounding in addition and subtraction routine
  <li>Fixed accuracy problem of e<sup>x</sup> and 10<sup>x</sup>
  <li>More accurate display of extremely large/small numbers due to
  accurate 10<sup>x</sup>
  <li>50-70% speedup of all operations due to inlining of small functions
</ul>

<h3><!--a href="Calc113.jar"-->Version 1.13<!--/a--></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Correct rounding in multiplication routine
  <li>More accurate exponential functions due to better multiplications
  <li>atan<sub>2</sub> result correctly converted in DEG mode
  <li>Changed exponent marker from "E" to "e", and hex digits from
  "abcdef" to "ABCDEF" to improve visibility of complex numbers
  <li>Removed "+" sign from positive exponents
  <li>Basic complex math works for +, -, *, /, +/-, &#8730;<span
  style="text-decoration: overline;">x</span>, 1/x,
  x², cplx&rarr;r, abs, arg, conj and STO/RCL
  <li>sqrt(-0) correctly returns 0
</ul>

<h3><!--a href="Calc111.jar"-->Version 1.11<!--/a--></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Made "int" submenu accessible in hex/oct/bin mode
  <li>Hex number "1.fffffffffffffffc" correctly displays "2"
  <li>Faster and correctly rounded division routine
  <li>Statistics log (used in "draw") now stores 64 x/y pairs and
  removes correctly on &#931;-
  <li>Using CRC rather than linear congruential generators in random
  number generator. RNG now passes <a
  href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/random/">ent</a> test
  <li>Released Real.java class under GPL
</ul>

<h3><!--a href="Calc108.jar"-->Version 1.08<!--/a--></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Added percent command to basic menu
  <li>Added undo command to stack menu (removed x&harr;st#)
  <li>atan<sub>2</sub>(0,0) correctly returns 0
</ul>

<h3><!--a href="Calc102.jar"-->Version 1.02<!--/a--></h3>

<ul>
  <li>y<sup>x</sup> faster and more accurate if x is integer
  <li>Added financial functions y%*x and y%/x
  <li>Added financial mode for beginning and end of month payments
  <li>Financial solving works properly with ir% = 0
  <li>Setup dialog to query about keyboard layout
</ul>

<h3><!--a href="Calc100.jar"-->Version 1.00<!--/a--></h3>

<ul>
  <li>First public version
</ul>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Bugs:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>None of the key mappings work on Nokia 6820 and 5140
  <li>P900 and P910 could work better with different key mapping
</ul>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Todo-list:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Fix the bugs
  <li>Different font for monitor items
  <li>Move "%" to math/simple and make this menu entry a "redo" of last
  command
  <li>Complex integration and differentiation
  <li>Help text popup for commands aborted due to bad parameters
  (draw, solve, integrate)
  <li>Error message popup where a "nan" result is inappropriate
  <li>The "guess" function from http://sourceforge.net/projects/easycalc
  <li>Matrix arithmetic?
</ul>

Things that <i>cannot</i> be implemented because the increased complexity
will make the application too large:

<ul>
  <li>Full programming mode with program listing, editing, and
  flow control operations such as IF, GOTO etc.
  <li>Expression evaluation, e.g. "2+3-5*sin(34.5)^2"
  <li>Symbolic differentiation and integration
  <li>Spreadsheet, thesaurus and encyclopedia
</ul>
