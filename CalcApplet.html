<p>
This demo applet can be operated entirely by mouse, clicking on
different areas of the "screen" activates the menu just as the
joystick would. The "<-" button simulates the clear key, the "."
button simulates the "*" key, and the "-/e" button simulates the "#"
key.

<p>
The applet can also be operated entirely by the keyboard. Arrow keys
work as joystick directions and "home" serves as the middle of the
joystick. For ease of use, the "." key works the same as the "*" key,
and "-" and "e" works the same as "#". "+", "ENTER" and the number
keys correspond to the same keys on the phone.
